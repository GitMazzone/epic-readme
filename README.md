# What is Wowza?

❤️ **More hacking, less setup.**

## Wowza saves you time

Wowza sets up initial scaffolding for JS/TS projects so you can start working sooner. This setup includes...

- A dope `README.md` for your contributors to appreciate, with _badges_!
- `.gitignore` based on project type, and [where to find others](https://github.com/github/gitignore)
- Modern tooling: Cypress, ESLint (Airbnb), Jest, Prettier, Semantic Release, Storybook
- CI config with CircleCI, Gitlab, or Buildkite
- VS Code extensions by project type, and some that are useful for all

# Getting Started

## Creating a Wowza Project

**Using `npx`**

```bash
npx wowza
```

The `wowza` command will ask you [TODO], which will configure some plugins and scaffolding to help you get started.

```
? [TODO] (Use arrow keys)
❯ empty             [an empty workspace with a layout that works best for building apps]
  oss               [an empty workspace with a layout that works best for open-source projects]
  angular           [a workspace with a single Angular application]
  react             [a workspace with a single React application]
```

## Serving Application

- Run `serve myapp` to serve the newly generated application.
- Run `test myapp` to test it.
- Run `e2e myapp-e2e` to run e2e tests for it.
