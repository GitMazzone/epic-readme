Features I'd like to implement

- CLI checkbox list to choose gitignore type (common 5-10)

  - Defaults to Node if none selected, link to github.com/github/gitignore

- Badge CLI generator

  - Get input from CLI during setup or after

- List of `wowza` CLI commands

  - `wowza` - initial setup & questions
  - `wowza-badges` - add badges to readme, can even generate API/endpoint

    - CI, make endpoint and API
    - License, replace \<type\>: `https://img.shields.io/badge/license-<type>-brightgreen`
    - Package versions, make endpoint and API

- Make note of all places in README where it can be templated.

  - Title
  - Logo
  - Description
  - Link to site
  - Link to `CONTRIBUTING.md`, link to submit issue
  - Badges
  -

Think about best user flow. Get the minimal amount of info to generate a project, or allow them to provide a package.json to generate from?
